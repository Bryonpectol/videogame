      <h1>Do Videogames Boost Creativity?</h1>
      <br />
      <p class="mainp">
        Everyone has heard the phrase, “video games will kill your brain cells,”
        or something along those lines. Is this phrase entirely true? Or has it
        just been brought up through the years by parents and other people
        trying to convince their loved ones not to play video games? Luckily for
        us, there has been quite a lot of experiments and research done about
        this topic. Although video games do have some negative effects on a
        person, there are a lot of positive effects too. One of the main things
        video games can do for a person is boost their creativity. People who
        play video games can think more critically and creativity. Video games
        can help a person so much that they have started implementing them into
        educational systems all over the world. In the article, The effective
        components of creativity in digital game-based learning among young
        children: A case study, from the Children and Youth Services Review, it
        says “One of the most recent growing trends in today's world is digital
        games using technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at
        home or at school” (Behnamnia, Najmeh et al., 2020). Using video games
        in an educational setting is called DGBL (digital game-based-learning).
        The video game Minecraft is a key building block (no pun intended) of
        DGBL and was one of the first games to be experimented with. Minecraft
        is a “sandbox” game set in a blocky pixel world where the player can go
        wherever they want to and build whatever they want to with a set list of
        different kinds of building blocks. Ever since the game was released
        back in May of 2009 (Minecraft, 2020), people have created everything
        from calculators to boats to drivable cars just by using four by four
        pixelated blocks. Already people started using their creativeness to
        build these extraordinary things, but Mojang (the owners of Minecraft)
        did not leave their game a static one.</p><br /> <p class="mainp">In the fall of 2016, Mojang
        released the Minecraft: Education Edition, but American and Swedish
        schools already started integrating Minecraft into their curriculum in
        2013 (Karsenti et al., 2017). In 2019, Iowa State University conducted
        an experiment with 352 university students. The experiment was created
        to measure creativity between the students as some of them played
        Minecraft, some of them played a different video game about driving, and
        some of them just watched a tv show (Blanco-Herrera et al., 2019). In
        the article, Video Games can Increase Creativity, but with Caveats, the
        authors explain, “Between-groups experimental analyses showed that
        players randomly assigned to play Minecraft without instruction
        demonstrated significantly higher scores on post-game creativity
        measures compared to those who played Minecraft with instructions to ‘be
        creative,’ those who played a driving game, or those who watched a
        television show.” This experiment proved that video games can increase
        creativity. That doesn’t mean that all video games will boost a person’s
        creativity, but it’s safe to say that most video games will have a
        positive effect on the players. Since Minecraft was released, there have
        been games like Terraria, Junk Jack, and many other video games that
        were created with the sole purpose to have the players be creative.</p><br /> <p class="mainp">The
        main point to obtain from this, is that video games in of themselves are
        not a bad thing for humans. Granted, there are a lot of video games out
        there that are bad for people to play. However, if a player plays video
        games with a creative, fun look towards them, then the video game will
        have a positive effect on the player. “Results indicate that effects are
        not solely predicted by game mechanics, but also by the way the player
        plays” (Blanco-Herrera et al., 2019).</p>
